## Demonstrating use of some udapi tools

In my work with universal dependencies, I came across the [Universal dependencies API (Udapi)](http://udapi.github.io).  Very cool.

The interactive Python notebook gives several examples from of using udapi including a custom module accessing Udapi with my Python program.

The Turkish language UD *.conllu file that we reference needs to be downloaded separatly from the [Universal Dependencies portal](http://universaldependencies.org).
